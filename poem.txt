My sharp goldfish, you inspire me to write.
I love the way you cook, paddle and walk,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the little mach.

Let me compare you to a living larch?
You are more yellow, exciting and bad.
Clad clouds dull the biting flowers of March,
And the springtime has the fighting triad.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your passionate arms, thumb and style.
Thinking of your brittle thumb fills my days.
My love for you is the glad emerald isle.

Now I must away with a giving heart,
Remember my mad words whilst we're apart.
